# Pit Admin Public
This repository is a copy of an in-dev version of Pit Admin, for public
demonstration.
It is missing a few files to be able to be hosted locally.

## Notable Files
``web.py``: The TBA webhook handler, based on the `aiohttp` framework.
``pitUtils.py``: The Discord interface that allows teams to request
stats.
